# FlowStims

This software is being developed at the Yale Computational Vision Lab by Luciano Dyballa under the guidance of Professor Steven W. Zucker.


## How to run it

You will find pre-compiled versions inside the Windows, Mac, and Linux folders. They require [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to be installed on your machine. Once you run the executable, it will prompt you to select a parameters file, which can used to configure every detail about the stimuli you want to show (flows or square-wave gratings). In `example-params.txt` you will find an example with descriptions of the basic parameters. More detailed information can be found in the [manual](doc/manual.md).

The program is written in Java using [Processing](https://processing.org), in case you'd like to edit the source code. Feel free to alter it according to your specific needs. Contributions are highly encouraged!
