# FlowStims

This software is being developed at the Yale Computational Vision Lab by Luciano Dyballa under the guidance of Professor Steven W. Zucker.

You can find more information about our flow stimuli in __Dyballa et al. 2018.__ _Flow stimuli reveal ecologically-appropriate responses in mouse visual cortex._ bioRxiv doi: 10.1101/362459

## How to run it

You will find pre-compiled versions inside the Windows, Mac, and Linux folders. They require [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to be installed on your machine. Once you run the executable, it will prompt you to select a parameters file, which can used to configure every detail about the stimuli you want to show (flows or square-wave gratings). In `example-params.txt` you will find an example with a description of the basic parameters. More information can be found in the `docs` folder.

The program is written in Java using [Processing](https://processing.org), in case you'd like to edit the source code. Feel free to alter it to your specific needs. Contributions are highly encouraged!
