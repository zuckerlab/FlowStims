FlowStims 2 #version information

# Use this file to set the parameters for the flow movies

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Any text after a '#' is ignored (comments)

# The format for entering values is: "parameter"<space>"value"
# For entering multiple values: "parameter"<space>"value1"<space>"value2" etc.

# An arrow "->" before a parameter name means it is dependent on the preceding param without an arrow (the "parent" parameter). The number of values entered for it must equal that of its parent.

# Specific parameter instructions are given as comments below. 


###SETUP###
scrWidthPx 800 #screen resolution - width, in pixels
scrHeightPx 600 #screen resolution - height, in pixels
scrWidthCm 40.0 #Physical width of screen (cm)
scrDistCm 25.0 #Distance from screen (cm)
monitor 1 #Selects the screen to display to program on (default is 1)
fastRendering 1 #Disable this (set to 0) for improved graphics (can be slow in some machines)
*frameRate 60 #Number of frames displayed every second (default is 60)
saveScrShots 0 #Save a screenshot of every frame for creating a movie
*randomSeed 11 #Pseudo rand. num. gen. initial state

###ALL STIMULI###
trialLenSec 1.5 #Trial length (stimulus presentation), in seconds.
preStimLenSec 1. #Pre-stimulus interval (for best results should be at least 1 sec)
postStimLenSec .5 #Post-stimulus interval. Note: Total time spent per trial is given by preStimLenSec + trialLenSec +  postStimLenSec

nTrialBlocks 3 #Number of blocks of trials (i.e., repetitions of each combination of parameters)

nDirs 8 #Number of principal directions (evenly divided around 360 degrees)
tempFreq 2.5 4 #Temporal frequency (cycles/s), can choose multiple
nFadeFrames 10 #Sets number of frames used for fade-in/out transitions (use 0 for no fade)

useMask 0
maskDiamDeg 30
maskHorzPos .75
->maskVertPos .5

###FLOW STIMULI###
useFlows 1 #Whether to display flows
nDots 1 3 #Number of dots used in the flow elements, can choose multiple

dotFgVal 200 #Grayscale value for foreground (dots) [0-255], multiple
->dotBgVal 127 #Grayscale value for background
->dotInterVal 80 #Grayscale value of interstimulus screen (use -1 for avg screen luminance of the stimulus)

dotDiamDeg .5 #Diameter of single dots (degs), multiple -- determines diams for other nDots (preserving const. area)
->dotSpacing 3.0 #avg spacing between flow element centers (in multiples of dotDiamDeg), must set a val for each dotDiamDeg used above

rigidTrans 0 #Set to 1 for a rigid translation of the flow elements, instead of "wiggly" motion
sepWeight 1.5 #Ratio between repulsion force between elts and the flow field force -- should be at least 1.5 for best results, and might need some adjustment for different dot sizes

*maxForce 0.04
*tileSize 2.5 #Tile size of the underlying vector field, in multiples of 
*dirStd 0.09 #Std. dev. of the direction distribution of the underlying flow field
*posStd 0.1 #Std. dev. of initial position of dots on screen, as a fraction of dotSpacing
*equalArea 0 #Whether to adjust the diameter of patterns with nDots > 1 so as to preserve the same total area as that of single dots -- default: yes (1)
fixRandState 1 #Set to 1 to make identical all trials of the same flow variation (fixes the initial dot positions and flow field)

###GRATINGS STIMULI###
useGratings 1 #Whether to display square-wave gratings
gratWidthDeg .5 #Width of grating bars, in degrees of visual angle, i.e. 1/(2*spat.freq.)
randGratPhase 0 #Set to 1 to enable random initial phase in each trial
gratFgVal 192 #Grayscale value of one half of the bars ("foreground") [0-255], can choose multiple
->gratBgVal 64 #Grayscale value of the other half of the bars ("background")
->gratInterVal 127 #Grayscale value of interstimulus screen (use -1 for avg screen luminance of the stimulus)

###NETWORK COMMUNICATION###
# Use this to configure which UDP packets are to be sent by the program whenever one of the events below is triggered (packet sending disabled if saveScrShots is on).

# Format:
#EVENT: <description of event that triggers the sending of the packet>
#<param> <host> <port> <msgType> <addNewLine> <encoding>

# The arguments: host, port, msgType, etc. must be configured by the user (do not change the param name!).
# Description of the arguments (do not change their order! -- the last two are optional):
  # host: host address that will receive the packets (UDP datagrams)
  # port: port that will be listening for the packets
  # msgType: 1=send as string, 2=send as integer
  # addNewline: 0 or 1 -- whether to add a '\n' char at end of msg. Default is no (0)
  # encoding: only applicable if sending a string. Default: UTF-8 (single byte chars)

# For multiple hosts per event, repeat this in multiple lines changing the arguments host, port, etc. for each one. Note: only clientStart and clientEnd allow multiple hosts.

#EVENT: beginning of presentation (sent only once, at the very beginning of the movie)
#clientStart host port msgType msg [addNewLine encoding]
clientStart localhost 9090 1 1

#EVENT: end of presentation (including early exit with <ESC> key)
#clientEnd host port msgType msg [addNewLine encoding] (for multiple hosts, repeat this in multiple lines changing host, port, etc. for each one)
clientEnd localhost 9090 1 0

#EVENT: start of each trial 
#clientTrialStart host port msgType msg [addNewLine encoding]
clientTrialStart localhost 9090 1 1

#EVENT: end of each trial
#clientTrialEnd host port msgType msg [addNewLine encoding]
